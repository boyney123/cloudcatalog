# Installation

Getting up and running with EventCatalog should take a few minutes (hopefully!).

## Requirements {#requirements}

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 20.5.1 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) version >= 1.5 (which can be checked by running `yarn --version`). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the `npm` client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.

## Scaffold project website {#scaffold-project-website}

The easiest way to install CloudCatalog is to use the command line tool that helps you scaffold a skeleton CloudCatalog website. You can run this command anywhere in a new empty repository or within an existing repository, it will create a new directory containing the scaffolded files.

```bash
npx @cloudcatalog/create-catalog@latest [name]
```

Example:

```bash
npx @cloudcatalog/create-catalog@latest my-cloudcatalog
```

## Project structure {#project-structure}

Assuming you named your site `my-cloudcatalog`, you will see the following files generated under a new directory `my-cloudcatalog/`:

```bash
my-cloudcatalog
├── data
│   ├── resources
│   │    └──lambda
│   │       └──payment-emails.md
│   │       └──process-payments.md
│   │       └──process-signups.md
│   │    └──services
│   │       └──Payment Service
│   │       │   └──index.md

```

## Running the development server {#running-the-development-server}

To preview your changes as you edit the files, you can run a local development server that will serve your website and reflect the latest changes.

```bash
cd my-cloudcatalog
npm run dev
```

By default, a browser window will open at http://localhost:3000.

🎉 Congratulations! **You have just created your first CloudCatalog site!**

## Adding resources to your Catalog

Using the `@cloudcatalog/cli` you can import AWS resources into your Catalog.

Head over to the [resource guide](/docs/overview/guides/resources/introduction) to get started.

CloudCatalog is currrently new and only supports importing Lambda functions at the moment.

We are looking for contributors to help us scale and import many other resources.

## Building your catalog {#build}

CloudCatalog uses NextJS under the hood. To build the website run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will output your catalog to the `out` directory. 

CloudCatalog is a static website that can be hosted anywhere. See [deployment docs](/docs/overview/guides/deployment) for more information.
