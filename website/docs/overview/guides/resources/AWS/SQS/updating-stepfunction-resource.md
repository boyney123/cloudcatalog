# Updating AWS fields

Overtime you will want to update the information pulled from AWS in your Catalog.

You can do this by [rerunning `import-resource` command](/docs/overview/guides/resources/AWS/SQS/adding-resource). This will keep your markdown properties and override the CloudCatalog owned properties.

:::info
A new feature is being built that will allow you to pull latest resources on build, meaning you don't have to do this manual feature.
